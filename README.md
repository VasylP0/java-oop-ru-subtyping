# Java OOP — Subtyping Project

This project is part of the **Hexlet Java OOP course**.  
It demonstrates the principles of **subtyping**, **polymorphism**, and **inheritance** in Java, using collections and hierarchies to show how different object types can share a common interface and behavior.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
The goal of this assignment is to explore how subtyping enables code reuse and flexibility in OOP systems.

Key learning points:
- Understanding subtyping and how it differs from inheritance  
- Using interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts  
- Leveraging polymorphism to treat different object types uniformly  
- Practicing design principles like *Liskov Substitution* and *Open/Closed*

---

## 🏗️ Main Components
Typical classes and concepts demonstrated:
- **Base classes / interfaces** – define common behavior  
- **Derived implementations** – extend or implement shared interfaces  
- **Collections of mixed types** – demonstrating how subtyping allows unified handling of multiple object types  
- **Unit tests** – verifying type relationships and behavior consistency

## 🧪 Run Tests
To verify correctness locally:
```bash
./gradlew clean test
